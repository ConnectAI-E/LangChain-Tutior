1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
In this short course, you saw a range of applications, including processing customer reviews and

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,840
building an application to answer questions over documents, and even using an llm to decide

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,080
when to make a call to an external tool like web search to answer complex questions.

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,400
If a week or two ago, someone had asked you how much work would it be to build all of

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,800
these applications, I think a lot of people thought, boy, this sounds like weeks, maybe

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,200
even longer of work.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,640
But you saw in this short course how with just a pretty reasonable number of lines of

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,600
code, you can use Langtrain to build all of these applications pretty efficiently.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
As I hope you take these ideas, maybe you can take some code snippets that you saw in

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,120
the Jupyter notebooks and use them in your own applications.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,320
And these ideas are really just the start.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,920
There's a lot of other applications that you can use language models for.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,680
These models are so powerful because they're applicable to such a wide range of tasks,

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,600
whether it be answering questions about CSVs, querying SQL databases, interacting with APIs.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,740
There's a lot of different examples of using chains and the combinations of prompts and

16
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,040
output parsers and then more chains to do all these things in Langtrain.

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,200
And most of that is due to the Langtrain community.

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,360
So I want to also give a really big thank you to everyone in the community who's contributed,

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,560
whether it be improvements in the documentation, making it easier for others to get started,

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,360
or new types of chains, opening up a whole new world of possibilities.

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,560
And so with that, if you have not yet already done so, I hope you go to your laptop, your

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,720
desktop and run pip install Langtrain.

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:54,000
And then go use this too to go build some amazing applications.
