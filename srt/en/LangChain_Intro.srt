00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
Welcome to this short course on

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,040
LandChain for large language model application development.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,480
By prompting an llm or large language model,

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,600
it's now possible to develop AI applications much faster than ever before.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,800
But an application can require prompting an llm multiple times and parsing as output.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,220
So there's a lot of glue code that needs to be written.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:34,360
LandChain created by Harrison Chase makes this development process much easier.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,280
I'm thrilled to have Harrison here,

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,920
who had built this short course in collaboration with

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,680
deeplearning.ai to teach how to use this amazing tool.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,400
Thanks for having me. I'm really excited to be here.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,760
LandChain started as an open source framework for building all on applications.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,360
It came about when I was talking to a bunch of folks in the field who were

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,200
building more complex applications and saw

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,760
some common abstractions in terms of how they were being developed.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,320
We've been really thrilled at the community adoption of LandChain so far.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,400
So look forward to sharing it with everyone

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,960
here and look forward to seeing what people build with it.

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,700
In fact, as a sign of LandChain's momentum,

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,920
not only does it have numerous users,

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,000
but there are also many hundreds of contributors to the open source.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,760
This has been instrumental for its rapid rate of development.

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,440
This team really shifts code and features at an amazing pace.

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,960
So hopefully, after this short course,

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,720
you'll be able to quickly put together some really cool applications using LandChain.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,280
And who knows, maybe you even decide to

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,800
contribute back to the open source LandChain effort.

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,360
LandChain is an open source development framework for building applications.

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
We have two different packages,

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
a Python one and a JavaScript one.

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,600
They're focused on composition and modularity.

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,960
So they have a lot of individual components that can be

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,320
used in conjunction with each other or by themselves.

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,080
And so that's one of the key value adds.

35
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,680
And then the other key value add is a bunch of different use cases.

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,280
So chains of ways of combining these modular components into

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,680
more end-to-end applications and making it

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,640
very easy to get started with those use cases.

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,080
In this class, we'll cover the common components of LandChain.

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,520
So we'll talk about models.

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,560
We'll talk about prompts, which are how you get

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,080
models to do useful and interesting things.

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,480
We'll talk about indexes,

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,920
which are ways of ingesting data so that you can combine it with models.

45
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,480
And then we'll talk about chains,

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,280
which are more end-to-end use cases along with agents,

47
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,920
which are a very exciting type of end-to-end use case,

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,680
which uses the model as a reasoning engine.

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,320
We're also grateful to Ankush Gholar,

50
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,600
who is the co-founder of LandChain alongside Harrison Chase,

51
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,840
for also putting a lot of thoughts into

52
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,480
these materials and helping with the creation of this short course.

53
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,840
And on the deep learning.ai side,

54
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,080
Jeff Ludwig, Eddie Hsu, and Diala Ezzedine,

55
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,840
have also contributed to these materials.

56
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,040
And so with that, let's go on to the next video where we'll learn

57
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:21,040
about LandChain's models, prompts, and pauses.
